Sudoku notes

Functionality:
- User can play sudoku and click to see if their board is correct.
- "Reveal solution" button. Uses backtracking algo to produce board (maybe, just maybe animate 
	the backtracking solution if I have the time)
- Timer

Playing sudoku:
- Barebones method: tkinter "entry" object, just type number in each box
- TechWithTim method (I think): press box, another small box pops up over the board with 
	all possible values to input.
	- subscript functionality: allows for player to put potential numbers in a box for reference
    - Erase button (for each box)
